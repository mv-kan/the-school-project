# The problem


## General situation
There is a little school called Awans. And in that school pupils have **the problem**. Awans manages not only "very good" education, but also payments for dormitories where pupils are living. 
So there is a poor accounting lady named Paulina who receives payments. And Paulina is not very fast with her paper-based accounting methods. To be honest she is quite slow especially at the end of the month and pupils are not really satisfied with that. 

## Facts about problem
So I "talked" to Paulina to help her out. And I have got general structure from her. There are 4 dormitories with different rates and prices. Also in those dormitories are supervisors who are looking after kids in dorms. In each dormitory all rooms are numbered and methods of numbering rooms are different. For e.g. Assystent (name of dorm) has rooms with letters (19B, 19A) and Laura has only digit numbered rooms (415, 414). And Awans rents those buildings so not every room is available to Awans. For e.g. first floor can be rented to other entity that Awans. 
And about accounting and pupils. Pupils are in classes called like this "TiB1", "TiA2". The number is year of studying, "Ti" is name of faculty/specialization, "B" is the letter of class (A, B, C etc etc)
Each pupil has email/phonenumber for contact, but it is optional. Pupils pays their rent each month also some pupils pay for food, provided by Awans (It is bad, do not buy it). And it is mandatory to pay for food for first year pupils (I cannot blame them for giving bad food to kids and making it mandatory to pay for this bad food, who am I to blame them?) 
Not all pupils live in the dorms. Also not all residents of dorms are pupils.
